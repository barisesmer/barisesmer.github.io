My name is Barış Can Esmer. Currently, I am a Ph.D. student at Saarland University (and doctoral researcher at CISPA) advised by [Dániel Marx](https://cispa.de/en/people/c01dama/). 

Nowadays, my research interests are parameterized complexity, fine-grained lower bounds, and (parameterized) approximation algorithms, though I am interested in theoretical computer science in general.

I received my Master’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science at Saarland University in 2021, and before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at Boğaziçi University, Turkey, in 2019.

In my spare time, I usually travel, go swimming, hit the gym, (try to) play <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oud'>the oud</a> or play computer games.
